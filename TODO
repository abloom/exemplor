Stuff that's on my radar:

* Halt()
* Run Assert() and Show() checks should appear before the error report
* --version arg

* Documentation on how to use with rack
* Documentation on why the one-context-per-file approach is used

* An exemplor executable that can run multiple example files

* test stderr capturing
* adding symbol to_proc and tap to ext.rb
* test requiring an examples file from another file does *not* trigger at_exit
