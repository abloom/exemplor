Stuff that's on my radar:

* Halt()
* --version arg
* an exemplor executable that can run multiple example files
* TextMate bundle that does nice cmd+r output
* document why the one-context-per-file approach is used
* test stderr capturing
* adding symbol to_proc and tap to ext.rb
* test requiring exemplor does *not* trigger at exit
