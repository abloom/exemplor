Examplor (the exemplar)
=======================

An example-based test framework inspired by [testy](http://github.com/ahoward/testy).

Simpler that BDD/TDD, fancier than a file with a bunch of print statements.

Very tiny api. Here it is
    
    Examples do
      ... your helpers ...
    end
    
    Examples "A group of examples" do 
      
      setup { ... setup codez ... }
      
      eg "an example" do
        some_var = example_usage_of_your_lib
        Check(some_var)
      end
      
      eg "this example includes an assertion" do
        Check(numerical_meaning_of_life).is(42)
      end
      
    end

The output is both human readable and machine parsable, which means you can test your tests.
